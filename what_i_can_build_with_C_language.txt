C is a powerful, low-level programming language, and you can build a wide range of software with it — especially where performance, control, and efficiency matter.

Here’s a list of what you can build with C:


---

1. Operating Systems

Linux kernel

Unix

Embedded OS (RTOS)

Windows (some parts)



---

2. Embedded Systems

Microcontroller firmware (AVR, ARM, STM32, etc.)

IoT devices

Robotics control systems



---

3. System Software

Compilers (e.g., GCC)

Assemblers, linkers

Shells (e.g., Bash)

Device drivers



---

4. Game Development

2D/3D games (low-level game engines)

Graphics libraries (OpenGL, SDL)

Game logic for retro and console games



---

5. Networking Tools

Custom TCP/IP stacks

Packet sniffers

Firewalls and VPNs

Load balancers and proxies



---

6. Databases and Interpreters

Build your own mini database

Command parsers

Scripting language interpreters (like Lua’s core)



---

7. CLI Tools and Utilities

File managers

Process monitors

Backup and sync tools

Custom commands (like htop, rsync, grep)



---

8. Security Tools

Exploit development

Buffer overflow tests

Pen-testing tools (like parts of Metasploit or Nmap)



---

9. Real-time & Industrial Systems

Automotive control software

Industrial automation

Medical devices



---

10. GUI Applications (with libraries)

Using GTK, Qt (C-based bindings)

Cross-platform tools
